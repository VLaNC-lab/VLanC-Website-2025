At the **VLANC** Lab, we integrate **Vision**, **Language**, and **Knowledge** to build intelligent, multimodal AI systems. Our research spans graph-based models for **Entity Linking**, **Knowledge Graph** construction from unstructured text, multimodal reasoning over image-text data, and **Deep Generative** models for **Brain-Computer Interface** signals. We also advance low-resource learning and domain adaptation to create robust, generalizable AI models bridging AI and neuroscience.
