## Highlights

{% capture text %}

At the **VLANC** Lab , our research lies at the intersection of **visual understanding**, **natural language processing**, and **neural cognitive computing**. We focus on developing intelligent systems that can interpret, reason over, and generate multimodal content by combining structured knowledge with deep learning. Our work involves **natural language understanding**, **knowledge graph construction and reasoning**, **graph neural networks**, and **deep generative models**. We also explore **brain-computer interfaces** and **information extraction from unstructured data**, with an emphasis on building **human-centric AI systems** that support **knowledge discovery**, **adaptive decision-making**, and **cognitive interaction**.

At the **VLANC** Lab, our projects focus on integrating **vision**, **language*, and *knowledge** to develop intelligent systems capable of understanding and reasoning about multimodal data. Current projects include **graph-based models** for **entity linking**, **knowledge graph** construction from unstructured text, multimodal reasoning across image-text pairs, and deep generative models for **brain-computer interface** signals. We also explore low-resource learning and domain adaptation to ensure our models are robust and generalizable.
