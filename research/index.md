<h1 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">üî¨ Research </h1>

At the **Visual Language Neural Cognitive Computing (VLANC) Lab**, our research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and multimodal learning. We explore how machines can understand and integrate **language, vision, and structured knowledge** to simulate human-like cognition and reasoning.

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Key Research Areas </h2>


<details markdown="1">
<summary>üß† Knowledge Graphs & Reasoning </summary>
Building and utilizing domain-specific knowledge graphs for information extraction, semantic understanding, and intelligent decision-making.
</details>

<details markdown="2">
<summary>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</summary>
Investigating transformer-based models for understanding and generating human language, with applications in dialogue systems, question answering, and summarization.
</details>


<details markdown="3">
<summary>üëÅÔ∏è Vision-Language Integration</summary>
 Bridging visual and textual modalities using deep learning techniques for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and scene understanding.
</details>
  
<details markdown="4">
<summary>üîÑ Multimodal & Cognitive Computing </summary>
 Combining signals from various modalities to model human-like cognition, including memory, attention, and reasoning.
</details>

<details markdown="5">
<summary>üìäApplied Machine Learning </summary>
  Designing ML and DL solutions for real-world problems in education, job skill matching, and social platforms.
</details>

Our goal is to push the boundaries of AI to create systems that can **think, learn, and interact** with the world in more human-like ways.
